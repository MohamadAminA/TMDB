# üé¨ **TMDB Movie Database Web Application** (ASP.NET MVC)

## üåü **Project Overview**  
This project is a full-featured movie database web application built using the **ASP.NET MVC** framework. It leverages **The Movie Database (TMDB) API** to fetch and display real-time movie information such as titles, release dates, ratings, and more. The app offers an IMDb-like experience, allowing users to browse, search, and view detailed movie data easily.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Running the Project Locally**  

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  
Start by cloning the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamadAminA/TMDB.git
cd "C://.../TMDB"
```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**  
Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- **.NET Core SDK 6.0+**
- **SQL Server (or SQL Server Express)**
- **Visual Studio 2022** (or any preferred IDE)

### **Step 3: Configure TMDB API Key**  
To fetch movie data, you‚Äôll need a valid **TMDB API key**. You can get one by signing up at [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

Once obtained, add the API key to the `appsettings.json` file:

### **Step 4: Database Setup**  
If the project includes database interactions (such as saving favorite movies), you'll need to create the database.

In **Visual Studio**, open the **Package Manager Console** and run the following command:

```bash
Update-Database
```

This will create the necessary tables in your SQL Server instance.

### **Step 5: Build and Run**  
Once everything is set up, you can build and run the project. Open **Visual Studio**, hit **Start**, or press `F5`. The application should open in your default browser at `http://localhost:xxxx/`.

### **Step 6: Accessing Movie Data**  
Once running, navigate to the homepage, where you‚Äôll see a list of the latest movies fetched from the TMDB API. You can search for movies, view their details, and explore other features.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**  

- **API Key Issues**: Make sure your TMDB API key is valid and correctly added to the `appsettings.json` file.
- **Database Issues**: Verify your connection string is correct, and ensure SQL Server is running.
- **Missing Content**: If posters or other content are missing, check your API rate limits and permissions.
